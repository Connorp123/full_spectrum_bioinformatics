    "# Designing your bioinformatics project\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll soon be diving into many specific techniques that you can use in bioinformatics. However, many people find that it is easiest to learn this type of skill if you are applying what you are learning to a specific project that you care about. However, it is also easier to pick projects once you have some idea of what kind of questions bioinformatics can and can't easily address. Feel free to jump ahead to the chapters on specific methods and practice some examples first.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do you design a good bioinformatics project?\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on your perspective, developing a scientific question that you'd like to answer may sound simple - or perhaps frighteningly open-ended. There is a sense (which we'll discuss below) in which something as simple as picking a project speaks to some fairly deep philosophical questions about how we come by scientific knowledge. So there is *a lot* that you can learn about designing an experiment or analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "But for now - especially if you are just starting out - it is most important that you *pick an interesting question* and *start trying to answer it*. You can learn a lot about what you need to learn in order to address it along the way. Don't feel like the first question that interests you is written in stone either. There are no penalty points awarded in science for switching questions (indeed this happens all the time!), so it is a good idea to think about the first question that interests you as a starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What makes a good scientific question?\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes a good scientific question is of course somewhat subjective. I'm going to present my opinion. This advice is especially focused on scientific questions that you can pursue mostly independently as an advanced undergraduate or early graduate school student, without a source of funding to collect new data. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are an experienced researcher heading a biological laboratory, some important considerations will be different (e.g. how will I get funding for the project?), but if you are in that position you are likely already all to familiar with those consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Down below we'll talk a little more about a specific *process* for developing a question, so don't feel like you have to magically come up with one out of thin air. But for now let's get some sense of what we're aiming for.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Here's what I think you should look for when picking a scientific question for *your* project:__\n",
    "\n",
    "- **It interests *you***. Answering most questions in bioinformatics takes significant time and dedication. So the most important criteria in picking a question is that you genuinely care about the answer. You might care because of simple curiosity, or because you think the answer might suggest a new approach to a societal problem (e.g. predicting flu outbreaks to better target vaccines). No two humans have identical experiences, and so it's OK if the question that interests you is not the same as that that interests other people. Indeed, that's one reason that you have something unique to contribute to bioinformatics. Conversely, just because you think a question is important doesn't necessarily mean it's the best one for *you* to address. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **It is relatively specific**. The first questions that you think of may be very broad. (\"How do cells work? How did selfless behavior evolve?\"). Some might take a career's worth of work. Others might take concerted effort from the whole global scientific community over an a long time to really answer. If you come up with a very broad question, don't throw it away. You can save it, but understand that you will likely have to definitively answer many smaller (more 'bite-sized') questions in order to build up an understanding that speaks to your main question. Referring  it will be very useful later on \n",
    "\n",
    "- **It is one that *you* can start working on now**. In science, getting your hands dirty always beats idle speculation. You want a question that you can start addressing *now*. If you are a student who is new to bioinformatics, that typically means that the data you would need to test different hypotheses about your question are available and in a format that is not too difficult to work with. Down below we'll talk more about hypotheses and go over some of the common data formats that you might look for. Although there are thousands of data formats that are used by specific software packages in bioinformatics, many interesting problems can be addressed with data that are in a much more managable number of formats (say 4 or 5). Overall, it is much better to pick a question that you can make some progress on soon using data that is already available than it is to pick a very broad or unanswerable question. \n",

    "__Example__: I am very interested in the metabolism of a very rare snail that lives only on Madagascar and for which no genome or other 'omics data are available. The first thing I write down is \"How does this snail  If I have local access to that snail, there may be some laboratory experiments I could devise that would let me start working now on how this snail breaks down it's food. However, because there aren't many data available on this particular snail, asking questions about its metabolism probably isn't a good topic for a first bioinformatic project. But I understand that I don't have to stick with my first question - I can adjust the question to make it answerable given the time, resources, and skills I have available to me. So I could broaden the question to ask about metabolism in all snails or all mollusks. I might also notice that 'how does metabolism work' is extremely broad. Maybe what really interested me was how the snail dealt with a particular toxin from a plant that it eats. If so, I could \n",

    "## A process for developing a specific scientific question\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a general topic in mind, the basic process for developing a specific scientific question is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Review the literature about your topic.** It's just fine to start with Wikipedia or a news article. It might seem backwards to read when what you want to do is write down a specific question and hypotheses. I promise, however, that if you immerse yourself in what's already known about a topic, questions and ideas will start to emerge. I talk more about some specific ways you can do a simple mini literature review in a very short amount of time below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Talk with researchers in the area.** Once you have done your mini literature review and have some idea of what is known about your topic, it can be helpful to bring a list of brainstormed ideas to someone working in that area. If you are taking a class, you might bring them to office hours or schedule a meeting with the instructor.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Try talking your ideas out with others who are at a similar stage.** If you find a particular question is easy to explain to others in a way that they clearly understand, that may be a sign that the question really is a clear and interesting one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conducting a literature mini-review\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Finding peer reviewed-studies\n",
    "When doing bioinformatics, we want to focus on *peer-reviewed* scientfic publications. These are publications that have been read over and approved by several other scientists working in similar areas. The peer-review process is not perfect, but does tend to filter out many very poorly conceived or executed experiemnts, so in general you will find higher quality results if you look for peer-reviwed studies than if you do a general internet search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two common resources for finding peer-reviewed studies on your topic are [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)'s [PubMed search engine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Excercise: Build a table of studies for your mini-literature review\n",
    "\n",
    "I am very lazy. Just really abysmally lazy. However I also like to do a good job on projects that I'm pursuing. One way to do that is by getting good at *not wasting effort*. You can start right now as you begin your literature review. Even though your first steps might feel preliminary, getting organized now will save a ton of effort later on. \n",
    "\n",
    "So here's what I recommend. Set up a table of studies that address your question. Look up at least 10 peer-reviewed studies using [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or [PubMed search engine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) that look interesting and address your topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you do anything else, just enter the information for these studies into your table. For now, you just want to enter into the table the basic information about the paper (the last name of the first author, the year of publication, the journal, the paper's title and a hyperlink to take you back to it).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have that recorded, I'll say something that you won't hear very many instructors say: **don't read the papers**. Or at least, don't feel that you must read each one, in full, from start to finish right now. You may very well *end up* reading all of them in detail if you continue to work on your question, but it is not necessary (and may be counterproductive) to try to do that right at the beginning. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Instead*, read the abstract of each paper (see below). Try to look for the key pieces of information in the example table. When you enter the information, also mark your 'depth of reading' as 'abstract only'. That will be very useful later on when you have read some papers but not others.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Reading an abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Most peer-reviewed scientific papers have an abstract, which is like a version of the paper in minature. They are very, very short - from just 150 to about 500 words - so you can read a **lot** of them in an hour. In a good abstract, you should be able to figure out why the researchers care about the topic they're studying (though that one varies a lot), what question *they asked*, their hypothesis (if any), the methods they used to test the hypothesis, the results of their experiment or analysis, and the broader implications for their original question. Typically each of these will be covered in just one or two sentences.\n",

    "## Developing hypotheses from your question\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have picked a sufficiently specific research question, then hypotheses are simply possible answers to that question. However, they are not just any answer to the question. \n",
    "\n",
    "The best hypotheses are *very specific* answers to your question that make detailed and testable *predictions* about the world. That is to say, good hypotheses make predictions that are so specific that they can be tested. If our hypothesis isn't right (most aren't and that's OK!) we'd like to find that out as quickly as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *worst* scientific hypotheses we can write are mushy. They may not make any predictions that can be tested with data. Or they may make predictions, but those predictions are so vague that really any data one could possibly collect would be consistent with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to spot - and fix - mushy hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's easiest to think about how to design a good hypothesis by considering some pretty bad ones. I work in the area of microbial ecology, studying the various microorganisms that live in and on animals. One hypothesis that several papers in the area purport to test is that the set of microbes living on tropical corals  (the 'coral microbiome') is very diverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "I consider this hypothesis pretty bad. First, it's quite vague. When we say the microbes are diverse, do we mean in terms of *which* species are present or what they can do (these don't always line up perfectly)? What do we mean by 'very diverse'? If I find 50 species of bacteria living on a coral, is that 'highly diverse'? What about 20? 200? In other words, what would 'not diverse' mean? \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we are focused on species diversity. One way we could make our hypothesis less mushy is by making it comparative. For example, maybe we mean that corals have a diverse microbiome *relative to* all other animals. Or maybe we mean that corals have a diverse microbiome *relative to* the microbes that normally live in tropical seawater or seafloor sediments. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare these examples and see if you agree that one is a lot less specific than the others:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"Coral microbiomes are highly diverse\"\n",
    "2. \"More species of microorganisms live on corals than live in surrounding seawater\"\n",
    "3. \"More species of microbes live on corals than other animals\"\n",
