    "# Monte Carlo Methods and the Fundamental Unity of Statistical Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "## Roadmap\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we will use what we know about coding to cheat at statistics using an important class of techniques called Monte Carlo methods. We will not be cheating in the sense of doing something unethical, but only in the sense of using what we know about python to answer statistical questions without doing very much math. In so doing, I hope that we will develop an intuitive sense for the types of questions statistical tests are trying to answer. At the outset, statistical methods can sometimes feel like a grab-bag of random formulas with little relation to one another: T-tests, Pearson and Spearman regression, ANOVA, etc. It is easy to miss the fundamental unity of the questions asked by these tests, and the approach they take to answer them. By using Monte Carlo methods, I hope we will begin to see that many statistical questions are often very simple and indeed nearly all follow a straightforward common pattern. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately we will come full circle and discuss how even though we can answer a very wide array of statistical tests using Monte Carlo methods, traditional statistical methods can be much faster and more convenient when their assumptions hold true. "

    "## The Monte Carlo approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo approaches are named after the Monte Carlo casino in Monaco. As the name suggests, these methods use random *simulation* or *permutation* to calculate statistical quantities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example of using simulation to solve a problem: say we want to know the probability of dealing three Aces in a hand of five cards drawn from a [standard 52 card deck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck). If we have already taken a class or two in probability and statistics, we could calculate this probability mathematically. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, strictly speaking we don't need much math to work out an answer if we have a lot of time on our hands. In principle we could simply get a pack of cards, deal a hand many many times, and count how often you get three Aces. If you divide the number of times you get three Aces in a hand by how many hands you dealt, you would then get the **probability** or **p-value** of getting three A aces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, you probably didn't get into bioinformatics because you liked boring and repetitive tasks like dealing thousands of hands of cards. If we know how to code, we can instead simulate dealing a hand of cards in the computer, and automate the dealing of hands many times using a for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start our discussion of Monte Carlo methods solving this problem using python, then turn to more biological problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python functions useful for Monte Carlo tests\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to write Monte Carlo tests in python, you'll want to make sure you are comfortable and familiar with for loops, if statements, and writing your own functions. If not, I recommend going back and reviewing or learning these topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the functions in the [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) module are often used when writing Monte Carlo tests. I'd like to share a few of the ones that I use most often:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **choice** function from the builtin random libary. This let's you choose one item from a sequence (e.g. a list) with each item getting equal chances of being drawn. More formally this is a uniform random choice."

    "## Biological Example: Tuatara Sex and Climate Change\n",
    "\n",
    "To start thinking about Monte Carlo methods, it is useful to begin with a [motivating example](http://datanuggets.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Tuatara-climate-change_StudentA.pdf). [Tuatara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuatara) are unique animals that live only in New Zealand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like many animals, Tuatara's biological sex is not fixed by purely genetic factors, but rather can also be influenced strongly by their environment. In the case of Tuataras, the temperature at which eggs are incubated determines sex - with low temperatures tending to produce females and higher temperatures producing males.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider how we might test whether unequal Tuatara sex ratios could be due to chance. For example, in August of 2000, Dr. Kristine Grayson and colleagues ([Grayson *et al*., 2014](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0094214)) report capturing 34 Tuatara, of which ~67.6% (23/34) were male and ~32.4% (11/34) were female. We might be interested to know if this data supports the idea that the environmental conditions in August of 2000 were driving Tuatara to an unequal sex ratio. How can we test this quantitatively? We will try to do so using a few general steps that we can reuse on other Monte Carlo problems. Here are the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write code for simulating the event we want to study\n",
    "- Write code for calculating whether the statistical event we are interested in occurs in a simulation. \n",
    "- Write code for running many simulations, adding up how often our event of interest occurs, and computing a Monte Carlo p value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### State the statistical event we wish to quantify\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into writing code, we should take a moment to think about the statistical event we want our p-value to represent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In frequentist statistics, the key to answering this question is to consider what null hypotheses we are testing. Here the main alternative hypothesis we've identified is that capturing 69.7%  male Tuatara's might be simply due to chance. Even if sex ratios were in reality equal we might have just gotten 'unlucky' in which 34 Tuatara were tagged. We want the p-value for getting 23/34 male Tuatara if the population is really 50% male (the null hypothesis). \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go on, and in order to remind ourselves later when we are interpreting our p-value, it's useful to write down exactly what null hypothesis we are testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Null hypothesis*: the population of Tuatara is equally balanced between male and female Tuatara.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have that out of the way, what is our statistical event of interest? In frequentist statistical hypothesis testing, the event of interest is often the chances of observing an **effect size** as big or bigger than  the observed one under a *null hypothesis* that represents an uninteresting, trivial or random outcome. If it is common to see as big of a difference as the one we saw under the null hypothesis, then our data do not provide strong evidence against the null hypothesis, and we would say that they are 'not statistically significant'. If instead we find that it is extremely unlikely to see as big of an effect as we actually observed, *if* the null hypothesis were true, then this argues that the null hypothesis is not responsible for producing our effect, and the effect we see is therefore 'statistically significant'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this only helps a little - we still have to say what we mean by **effect size**. Here, the effect we are interested in is the difference in the number of male vs. female Tuatara we caught. We could express our effect size in several ways. For example, we might measure our effect size as the raw difference in the number of male vs. female Tuatara, the Male:Female sex ratio we calculate, or in their proportion (67% male). For now let's go with the proportion male.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the null hypothesis it is useful to write down how we will calculate the effect size we are intersted in:\n",
    "> *Effect size*: the percentage of male Tuatara in our sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "This then allows us to write down our statistical event of interest: \n",
    "\n",
    "> *Statistical Event of Interest*: how often do we see Male tuatara compose 69.7% or more of a sample of 34 Tuatara? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Write code for a Monte Carlo test\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have identified our statistical event of interest, and written some notes that will let us interpret the resulting p-value, we can write our code. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Monte Carlo test will end up using a very similar recipe to the one in our deck of cards. For now, we need to worry about writing code to do two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simulating the situation (simulate catching 34 Tuatara *if* the null hypothesis were true and the population was 50% male and 50% female)\n",
    "2. Testing if our statistical event of interest occurred in the simulation (were there 69.7% or more Males)\n",
    "3. Write code to run the simulations and tests for our condition of interest in a for loop and report the final p value\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If this number is less than 0.05 your result would traditionally be considered statistically significant, in the sense that your null hypothesis had a less than 5% chance of producing such an extreme outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be a lot, but if we take it step by step and build simple functions hopefully the logic will be clear. Once you get it you can use this for a huge variety of statistical tests by modifying the code in steps 1 and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we'll simulate catching a single tuatara that might be male or female. To do this we'll write a function that let's us 'catch' a lizard and will return either the string 'Male' or 'Female'. \n"

    "- **Modify the Monte Carlo simulation of sex ratio significance to account for unequal capture rates**.  When conducting our Monte Carlo test for an even sex ratio in Tuatara, we assumed that male and female Tuatara were captured at equal rates. [Herrel *et al.* 2010](https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article/100/2/287/2450663) measured the length and bite force of male and female Tuatara and found that male Tuatara on average weighted 434.8 g while female Tuatara on average weighed 272.7 g. Let us assume for a moment that the chances of observing a male vs. female Tuatara are proportional to their mass, with more massive Tuatara's being easier to spot. (The details of this assumption are probably unrealistic, but hopefully the overall idea will still be illustrative).   If our observation were correct, then a true 50:50 sex ratio of Tuatara might result in an *observed* sex ratio that included more males (because they are, under our assumption, easier to spot). Specifically we'd expect to observe about 61.5% males even if the true sex ratio were 50:50. Modify the calculation of significance for the figure from ([Grayson *et al*., 2014](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0094214)) to calculate significance if the above assumption were correct.
