    "## The Command Line Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter introduces some basics of how to use a command line interface like the one pictured above. Examples of such command line interfaces are the MacOSX Terminal, Windows PowerShell or CMD.exe in Windows. Command line interfaces allow you to accomplish many tasks by typing specific commands. If you've seen a TV show where hackers inactivate a satellite by typing cryptic looking commands, that is a fantasy version of using the command line. For example, you can use a command line interface to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- move files around on your computer\n",
    "- delete files\n",
    "- install new software\n",
    "- create, view, and edit text documents\n",
    "- run software\n",
    "- open a connection to a remote computer\n",
    "- etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to use a command line interface is a foundational skill in bioinformatics, and requires practice. This can be a bit dry at first, however, so in this chapter we will use a special set of files and folders developed for this text that will let you navigate a small adventure while practicing. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are already familar with how to use such an interface, feel free to skip this chapter, although you may find the exercise amusing nonetheless. "

    "## Why use the command line?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using command line workflows rather than graphical software can enhance reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "Imaging that you have designed a brilliant and successful bioinformatic analysis that has made a major contribution to science or medicine. After weeks of work, you realize that there was a mistake with the first step in your project, and you need to repeat your work. What happens next?\n",
    "\n",
    "If all of your weeks of work happened in the way that many of us first started using computers - by pointing and clicking on what we wanted in programs with a graphical user interface (GUI) like Microsoft Excel - then you may be in for a great deal of frustration. You will have to redo all that work. If you took very careful notes - or have an exceptionally good memory - you may be able to speed up the process the second time. However, it will still be a lot of work, and it would be very easy to by mistake make some other change in your process that will affect the final outcome (and require repeating the process *again*). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine that there were a way to simply type a few words into your computer and rerun your entire analysis, changing only the first step. Clearly, that would make for both more reliable science, and a lot less frustration on your part. Command line interfaces can, with just a little extra care up front, allow you to do just this.\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea is known as **reproducibility**. Whenever possible scientific research should be reproducible both by the people who did the research, and by other research groups. The ease of creating reproducible workflows is a major motivator for using command line software in scientific research.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Much scientific software can only be run on the command line\n",
    "\n",
    "When programmers develop a program with a sophisticated graphical user interface , the design of that interface often takes significant effort. For scientific software, the number of users is often relatively small, so many cutting-edge packages may not necesarily have a graphical user interface included. Instead, you use the text commands on the command line to specific any of the options or commands you would normally have set in a graphical interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Many remote servers and supercomputer clusters can only be accessed via the command line\n",
    "\n",
    "If you go on for a little while in bioinformatics, you will find that you can be very greedy in terms of the size of datasets you analyze. Once you have a method working on a small data set, running it on a much larger one often only takes extra time on a computer, rather than very much extra work on your part. However, eventually the processing time for your analysis may get too long to do on a standard laptop or desktop. One solution is to break your problem up into smaller pieces that can be run at the same time - i.e. *in parallel* - and then run those pieces on a group of computers that are working together known as a computing cluster. Typically you have to know how to use a command line interface to work on a computing cluster. If you already develop your reproducible workflows in command line interfaces on your own computer, then it is much easier to move to a compute cluster if you need to. \n"

    "\n",
    "One of the biggest barriers that many students of bioinformatics face, if they have not worked with computers very much before, is understanding how to navigate the system by which files are organized on a computer. The main reason we need to know this is so that we can use text commands to tell scientific software exactly - or our own scripts written in a language like python or R - which data files to open. If you can understand this, a huge array of command line scientific programs will become much easier to use.\n",

On MacOSX this is typically represented as '/'. On Windows, the root of a particular volume is represented like C:\\. \n",

Instead, you might say something like, \"it's down the block and to the left.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relative paths** are a way to refer to folders by describing how to get there *from your current working directory*. They make use of the following abbreviations:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",

    "    ~               your 'home' directory (the directory you start in when you open a new shell session)\n",
    "    /               the root directory of your filesystem. \n",
    "    \n",
    " You can combine relative paths, so for example:\n",

    "So far we've learned how to open a command line interface, seen that we can use the *ls* command to look at files in our current working directory, and the *pwd* command to get an absolute path to our current working directory. We also studied some diagrams of file systems and tried to understand how to form absolute and relative paths. \n",

In the command python pick_otus.py --help, python is the program, pick_otus.py is a positional argument sent to that program, and --help is a flag parameter sent to that program. Positional arguments and parameters modify a programs behavior.\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In both of these cases, we ran these programs without any extra information - we just typed ls or pwd. However, many command line programs accept additional information in the form of **arguments** or **parameters**. These arguments can modify the behavior of a program. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine that you wanted to list the contents of a folder that was not your current working directory. Just typing ls won't work, because by default (unless told otherwise) it just lists what files and folders are in your current location. However, if we type a space after ls and then a relative or absolute path, the ls program will modify its behavior to show us the contents of whatever is at that path. Try this in your commad line interface:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ls ../\n",
    "    \n",
    " As you may recall from our discussion of relative paths up above, ../ is the relative path to whichever directory encloses the directory you are currently in (i.e. one step back towards the root). When you supply ../ as an argument to ls, you are telling it you want to list the contents of whatever directory encolses your current one. Note that you *must* type ls and then the relative path - if you simply type ../ the computer will interpret that as the name of the program you are trying to run, and complain that no such program exists.\n",
    " \n",
    "This way of supplying information to a program is called a *positional argument*. The computer will interpret the first word you type (i.e. whatever letters happen before the first whitespace) as the name of the program you are running. For programs that use positional arguments, subsequent words will be interpreted as arguments with specific meaning based on their order. For example, the mv command moves files or folders from one path to another. You tell it which is which by listing the 'from' path first and the 'to' path second.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other main way that command line programs can be given infromation is by *valued parameters* or *flag parameters*. To explain why these are useful, consider the following (true) story. Imagine you were trying to run a complex bioinformatic program that took more than 20 separate inputs to run. Now imagine that you had to type them all in as positional arguments in the correct order to get it to work. It might looks something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    evil_program 0.17 True ./genome_sequences/ 50000 True False True True 100 Spearman etc etc etc\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, it would be very difficult to use, and easy to make a critical mistake that would cause the program to fail - or worse run successfully but with incorrect parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem of how to supply lots of information is addressed by using valued or flag parameters. When you pass these parameters to a program you tell it what value you are setting. Therefore you can give them in any order. Here's the same program with valued parameters. While it might still look complex, you have a much better shot at getting the input right and remembering what each value means:\n",
    "\n",
    "    less_evil_program --similarity-threshold 0.17 --input-sequence-dir ./genome_sequences --save-output True --verbose False --multicore False --cleanup-intermediate-files True --min-seqs-per_sample 100 --correlation-method Spearman etc etc\n",
    "    \n",
    "In this second example, even if you don't know exactly what the program is doing, you hopefully have some sort of a guess as to what each parameter means. For example --input-sequence-dir ./genome_sequences might indicate that the program will run an analysis on all the sequence files in a directory, and you're telling it that it should do that for the genome_sequences directory, which is in your current working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this a bit more formal, for each valued parameter you put one or two dashes (depending on the program) and then the name of the parameter you want to set. After that you put a space and then the value you want to set that parameter to.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some programs, valued parameters have short one letter codes that can be accessed with a single dash. So for example instead of having to write out --input-sequence-dir ./genome_sequences, you might just be able to write -i ./genome sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "Most bioinformatics programs that run on the command line have large numbers of valued parameters that you can adjust. **flag parameters** are one way that programmers try to make interacting with these programs a little simpler. A flag parameter works just like a valued parameter, except you don't have to supply a value. So for example, running a program with the --verbose flag parameter might mean that it will print out wordy or 'verbose' text output to the screen as it runs. \n",
    "\n",
    "How can you figure out what arguments and parameters a program accepts? Most programs can be run with a help parameter (typically -h, --help, or -help) that will list out the arguments and parameters.  You can also use the *man* (short for manual) command and supply the name of the program you want to read the manual on.  For example,\n",
    "you can run \n",

    "    man ls \n",

    "and you will get a manuel for the ls command that lists all the parameters and arguments you can use to modify the behavior of the ls command and what each means. (When you are done reading the manuel you can hit q to quit)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you still need more information or want a tutorial, you can look up the name of the program on Google and read about its arguments and parameters in the online help. Most basic BASH commands have tons of documentation online that you can consult. \n"
