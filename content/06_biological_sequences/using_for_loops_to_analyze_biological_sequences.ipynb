For loops can loop over any *iterable* object. That means basically any python object that holds other objects, including strings, lists, sets, dictionaries, etc. Python will take our amino_acids object, and pick out the first item in it. In this case that's a D. It will then give that item the name amino_acid (effectively setting amino_acid = D). Finally it will execute all the code that is indented after the for loop for that amino acid. Then it will start over at the beginning, set amino_acid = N, and repeat the process until it runs out of amino acids.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to test out how for loops work for yourself, you can modify the above code to add print statements that report the values of variables throughout the process. For example, right after the first line of the for loop, you might add the code: print(\"Current amino acid = \",amino_acid). This would then report to you what the value of the variable amino_acid is each time through the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Terminology Sidenote: Iterations**\n",
    "> When programmers talk about code repeating a task, they will often call each time the task repeats an *iteration*. So we might say,'for each *iteration* of the for loop, the code does X,Y, and Z'. \n",

    "Some notes about the above code:\n",
    "* the range() function generates all the numbers between 0 and a specified number one by one. It is very commonly used in python to run a for loop a given number of times. Here we use it to run the for loop over each nucleotide in the sequence.\n",
    "* if using an if statement inside a for loop, the code inside the if statment is indented an *additional* level, as shown above.\n",
    "* notice that *before* we start the loop, we have already prepared two variables, shared and different, to hold the counts of shared and different nucleotides we generate inside the loop. It is very common to define some variable to hold your data before you start a loop. Notice that if these variables were instead defined *inside* the loop, they would reset the count every time the loop ran, resulting in the wrong answer."
